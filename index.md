# Research area

My main research interests are in the field of computer and network security, with particular attention to hardware-based trust, cloud infrastructures, network softwarisation and electronic identity. I'm particularly interested in novel forms of virtualisation, such as containers, as enabling factors for a faster and more scalable cloud environment.

# Education

**PhD Candidate in Computer and Control Engineering** at [Politecnico di Torino](http://www.phd-dauin.polito.it/) [nov 2016 - ongoing]

Working on a research topic on "Trusted and secure networks" within the [TORSEC](http://security.polito.it) Computer and Network Security Group of Politecnico di Torino. My main focus is on researching and prototyping architectures to enable security mechanisms on a softwarised network infrastructure, i.e. based on cloud and NFV principles. In this regard, my work focus on application of Trusted Computing mechanisms and technologies (e.g. the Trusted Platform Module) to this multi-domain environment.

**M.Sc in Computer Engineering** *magna cum laude* at [Politecnico di Torino](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/sviluppo.offerta_formativa.corsi?p_sdu_cds=37:18&p_lang=EN) [oct 2013 - dec 2015]

M.Sc Thesis on "Integration of digital signature services in the STORK 2.0 electronic identity platform". Tutors Andrea Atzeni, Paolo Smiraglia, Antonio Lioy.

# Work experiences

**Security Researcher** at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/) [feb 2016 - ongoing]

Working on hardware-based trust applied to highly virtualised infrastructures, such as Network Functions Virtualisation environments. Main focus on novel methodologies and architectures to secure multi-tenant, multi-domain platforms via hardware trust anchors. Minor research work on methods to enable cross-border validation of electronic identities (e-IDs) and of electronic signatures (e-Signatures).

**eIDAS system administrator** at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/) [feb 2016 - ongoing]

Developer and maintainer of an interoperability layer between the eIDAS cross-border centralised architecture and the Italian notified e-ID scheme, i.e. Sistema Pubblico per l'Identit√† Digitale (SPID). Contributor to the cloud-based deployment of the Italian eIDAS Node.

**Visiting Researcher** at the Bristol Security Lab of [Hewlett Packard Labs](https://www.labs.hpe.com/) [oct 2018 - dec 2018]

Design of a novel trust architecture to enable secure key management and attestation of heterogeneous virtualised instances (e.g. VMs, containers) based on Trusted Platform Modules.
