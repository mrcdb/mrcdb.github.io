# Work experiences

**Cloud Native Senior Consultant (formerly Cloud Native Security Engineer)** at [ControlPlane](https://www.control-plane.io), London UK [may 2022 - ongoing]

Threat modelling cloud-native deployments for clients, to assess risk, define high-impact threats and applicable security
controls to help de-risk them. Focusing on Kubernetes and container security, and in securing cloud services, infrastructures,
and pipelines. Helping companies build DevSecOps capabilities and migrate existing workflows and processes to more agile,
cloud-native solutions. Training clients on containers and cloud-native security. Contributions to the CNCF on security
projects and initiatives within the Security TAG. Speaker at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2024 and two Kubernetes
Community Days. Instructor for the "Kubernetes Security: Attacking and Defending Kubernetes" course for O'Reilly Online.

**Security Engineer** at [7Layers](https://www.7layers.it), Turin IT [feb 2020 - may 2022]

Research & Development of cyber-security solutions that both leverage proprietary technologies and custom-built tools for
the detection of security incidents and their remediation in heterogeneous target infrastructures. Focus on cloud
infrastructures and cloud-native technologies, interested in Kubernetes and container security. Technical proficiency on
advanced endpoint detection & response, log management & aggregation, and security automation tools.

**Avionic Systems Engineer** at [Leonardo Aircraft Division](https://www.leonardocompany.com/en/air/aircraft?WT.ac=Aircraft), Turin IT [dec 2019 - jan 2020]

Contributed on the development and integration of avionic subsystems within the fighter simulators of Leonardo [Ground Based Training Systems](https://www.leonardocompany.com/en/products/gbts).

**Security Researcher** at [Polytechnic University of
Turin](https://www.polito.it/), Turin IT [feb 2016 - nov 2019]

Designed and developed a trust architecture tailored for a lightweight cloud
environment and integrated in a Network Functions Virtualization platform.
Designed and developed a run-time remote attestation technology for containers.
Built a multi-container design for a virtual network function with mandatory
access control policies to secure inter-container communication and shared data
volumes.. Contributed to the design and architecture of the NFV platform defined
within the SHIELD Horizon 2020 project.

**Member of FICEP Technical Staff** at [Polytechnic University of
Turin](https://www.polito.it/), Turin IT [feb 2016 - nov 2019]

Designed and built a container-based infrastructure to deploy the eIDAS national
gateway for electronic identity. Developed a library to map the eIDAS
authentication protocol with the italian notified eID scheme, SPID. Maintained
the eIDAS national gateway for cross-border authentication in Europe in the
scope of the FICEP CEF project, which is in charge of implementing the EU eIDAS
regulation at national level in Italy.

**Backend Developer** at [MUSICO](https://www.musi-co.com/), Independent IT [jun
2019 - oct 2019]

Designed and developed the backend of an innovative music platform based on
Artificial Intelligence, featuring user management, client APIs, MIDI management
and real-time database storage. Assisted client-side encoding of MIDI data into
audio formats and anonymous client authentication via JSON Web Tokens.
Implemented the CI/CD pipeline of the platform and its cloud deployment on
various Platform-as-a-Service solutions leveraging container technologies.

**Visiting Researcher** at the Security Lab of [Hewlett Packard Enterprise
Labs](https://www.labs.hpe.com/), Bristol UK [oct 2018 - dec 2018]

Designed a novel extension to the Trusted Platform Module 2.0 architecture to
support virtualized environments by binding the physical device with one or more
virtual TPM instances. Compared to existing literature, this allows for
hardware-level security in a virtualized environment, so that cryptographic
material can be protected against in-memory attacks performed both at the
virtual and physical levels. Includes hardware-protected key management and
state preservation across restarts of the virtualized environment.

**Intern** at [TOP-IX Internet Exchange](https://www.top-ix.org/it/home/), Turin
IT [apr 2013 - sep 2013]

Learnt a full stack WSGI framework and implemented demonstrative web
applications leveraging the AGILE software development methodology, Test Driven
Development and rapid prototyping tools.

# Education

**PhD in Computer and Control Engineering** at [Polytechnic University
of Turin](http://www.phd-dauin.polito.it/), Turin IT [nov 2016 - jul 2020]

Worked on a research topic on "Security and trust in a Network Functions
Virtualisation Infrastructure" within the [TORSEC](https://security.polito.it)
Computer and Network Security Group of Politecnico di Torino.
My main focus was on researching and prototyping
architectures to enable security mechanisms on a softwarised network
infrastructure, i.e. based on cloud and NFV principles. In this regard, my
work focused on application of Trusted Computing mechanisms and technologies
(e.g. the Trusted Platform Module) to this multi-domain environment.
