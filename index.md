# Professional interests

My main interests are in the field of computer and network security, with
particular attention to hardware-based trust, cloud infrastructures, network
softwarisation and electronic identity. I'm particularly interested in novel
forms of virtualisation, such as containers, as enabling factors for a faster
and more scalable cloud environment. I am a passionate developer, and I truly
enjoy learning the best approaches and latest technologies to tackle software
engineering problems. I have had experiences on software engineering in heterogenous fields, from scientific research to aerospace & defense.

# Work experiences

**Security Engineer** at [7Layers](https://www.7layers.it), Turin IT [feb 2020 - ongoing]

Research & development of cybersecurity solutions that leverage proprietary technologies (FireEye, Palo Alto Networks) for the detection of security incidents and their remediation in heterogeneous target infrastructures, including clouds.

**Avionic Systems Engineer** at [Leonardo Aircraft Division](https://www.leonardocompany.com/en/air/aircraft?WT.ac=Aircraft), Turin IT [dec 2019 - jan 2020]

Contributed on the development and integration of avionic subsystems within the fighter simulators of Leonardo [Ground Based Training Systems](https://www.leonardocompany.com/en/products/gbts).

**Security Researcher** at [Polytechnic University of
Turin](https://www.polito.it/), Turin IT [feb 2016 - nov 2019]

Designed and developed a trust architecture tailored for a lightweight cloud
environment and integrated in a Network Functions Virtualization platform.
Designed and developed a run-time remote attestation technology for containers.
Built a multi-container design for a virtual network function with mandatory
access control policies to secure inter-container communication and shared data
volumes.. Contributed to the design and architecture of the NFV platform defined
within the SHIELD Horizon 2020 project.

**Member of FICEP Technical Staff** at [Polytechnic University of
Turin](https://www.polito.it/), Turin IT [feb 2016 - nov 2019]

Designed and built a container-based infrastructure to deploy the eIDAS national
gateway for electronic identity. Developed a library to map the eIDAS
authentication protocol with the italian notified eID scheme, SPID. Maintained
the eIDAS national gateway for cross-border authentication in Europe in the
scope of the FICEP CEF project, which is in charge of implementing the EU eIDAS
regulation at national level in Italy.

**Backend Developer** at [MUSICO](https://www.musi-co.com/), Independent IT [jun
2019 - oct 2019]

Designed and developed the backend of an innovative music platform based on
Artificial Intelligence, featuring user management, client APIs, MIDI management
and real-time database storage. Assisted client-side encoding of MIDI data into
audio formats and anonymous client authentication via JSON Web Tokens.
Implemented the CI/CD pipeline of the platform and its cloud deployment on
various Platform-as-a-Service solutions leveraging container technologies.

**Visiting Researcher** at the Security Lab of [Hewlett Packard Enterprise
Labs](https://www.labs.hpe.com/), Bristol UK [oct 2018 - dec 2018]

Designed a novel extension to the Trusted Platform Module 2.0 architecture to
support virtualized environments by binding the physical device with one or more
virtual TPM instances. Compared to existing literature, this allows for
hardware-level security in a virtualized environment, so that cryptographic
material can be protected against in-memory attacks performed both at the
virtual and physical levels. Includes hardware-protected key management and
state preservation across restarts of the virtualized environment.

**Intern** at [TOP-IX Internet Exchange](https://www.top-ix.org/it/home/), Turin
IT [apr 2013 - sep 2013]

Learnt a full stack WSGI framework and implemented demonstrative web
applications leveraging the AGILE software development methodology, Test Driven
Development and rapid prototyping tools.

# Education

**PhD Candidate in Computer and Control Engineering** at [Polytechnic University
of Turin](http://www.phd-dauin.polito.it/), Turin IT [nov 2016 - ongoing]

Working on a research topic on "Trusted and secure networks" within the
[TORSEC](https://security.polito.it) Computer and Network Security Group of
Politecnico di Torino. My main focus is on researching and prototyping
architectures to enable security mechanisms on a softwarised network
infrastructure, i.e. based on cloud and NFV principles. In this regard, my work
focuses on application of Trusted Computing mechanisms and technologies (e.g.
the Trusted Platform Module) to this multi-domain environment.
